        vi.falsely claiming or implying you’re connected to a person or organization (including Upwork) – for example, you can’t say you work for a particular company when you don’t, and agencies can’t use a freelancer’s profile if they’ve stopped working together.<br />
        Similarly, you must always be honest about who’s doing the work. That means you can’t:<br />
        vii.allow someone else to use your account, which misleads other users or<br />
        viii.falsely claim one freelancer will do a job when another does it including submitting a proposal on behalf of a freelancer who can’t or won’t do the work.<br />
